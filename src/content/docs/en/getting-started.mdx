# Getting Started

Welcome to Dormitricity! This guide will walk you through the basic features of the service, helping you monitor your dorm's electricity usage, understand trends, and set up timely alerts.

## Registration and Subscription

Before you can monitor a dormitory, you need to create an account and add a subscription.

1.  **Create an Account**: Visit the [Sign Up](/register) page. You will need to provide a valid email address and a password. After successful registration, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

2.  **Add Your First Subscription**:
    *   On the dashboard, click the "+" card to start adding a new subscription.
    *   The card will transform into an input form. Enter the dormitory ID (e.g., `5-202` or `E-505`). This is the unique identifier for your room.
    *   Currently, Dormitricity supports all dormitories at the main campus and Shahe campus whose electricity balance can be checked via a web page. If the remaining balance for your dorm does not appear on the main page 24 hours after setting up the subscription, please [open an issue](https://github.com/KeithCoreDumped/dormitricity-crawler/issues/new) in the crawler repository.
    *   Click the **"Add"** button. If the ID is valid, a new subscription card will appear on your dashboard.

You can subscribe to a maximum of three dormitories.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard provides an overview of all your subscribed dormitories. Each subscription is displayed on its own card.

### Subscription Card Components

*   **Dormitory ID**
*   **Latest Balance**: Shows the most recently recorded electricity balance (`kWh`) and the time of the update (typically updated every 10 minutes).
*   **Notification Status**: Indicates whether notifications are enabled for the current subscription and how many rules are active.
*   **View Trends** <LineChart className="h-4 w-4 inline-block align-text-bottom ml-1" /> button: Takes you to the electricity usage trend chart page.
*   **Settings** <Settings className="h-4 w-4 inline-block align-middle ml-1" /> button: Configure or test notification settings.
*   **Depletion Estimate**: If the electricity is about to run out, the page will display an estimated time until depletion based on your recent consumption rate.

## Analyzing Usage Trends

The "Trends" page allows you to get a detailed look at your electricity consumption.

*   **Time Range Selection**: Above the chart, select different time ranges to view your usage history, such as the last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.
*   **Interactive Chart**: The first line chart plots the dormitory's electricity balance (kWh) over time. You can hover over any point on the chart to see the exact balance at a specific time.
*   **Power Estimation**: The second chart shows the historical power consumption (kW) estimated from the remaining electricity balance. You can hover over any point to see the estimated power at a specific time.
*   **Depletion Estimate**: If the electricity is about to run out, the page will display an estimated time until depletion based on your recent consumption rate.
