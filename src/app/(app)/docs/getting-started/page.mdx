# Getting Started

Welcome to Dormitricity! This service helps you track your dormitory's electricity usage, view trends, and receive timely notifications to avoid running out of power.

## How It Works

Dormitricity works by periodically (every 10 minutes) scraping the electricity balance of subscribed dormitories. This data is then used to provide you with:

*   Historical data on your electricity balance and power consumption.
*   Trends and estimates for when your balance might be depleted.
*   Notifications to remind you to recharge.

## Key Features

*   **Dashboard:** Get an at-a-glance view of all your subscribed dormitories.
*   **Usage Trends:** View detailed charts of your electricity usage over time.
*   **Notifications:** Set up customizable notifications to be alerted before you run out of power. For more details, see the [Notifications documentation](./notification).

## System Architecture

The system consists of a Python-based crawler, a Cloudflare Worker backend, and a React-based frontend.
