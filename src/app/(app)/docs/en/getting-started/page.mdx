# Getting Started

Welcome to Dormitricity! This guide will walk you through the essential features of the service, helping you monitor your dormitory's electricity usage, understand trends, and set up timely alerts.

## First Steps: Registration and Subscription

Before you can monitor a dormitory, you need to create an account and add a subscription.

1.  **Create an Account**: Navigate to the [Register](/auth/register) page. You will need to provide a valid email address and a password. After successful registration, you will be automatically logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

2.  **Add Your First Subscription**:
    *   On the dashboard, you'll see a large card with a **"+"** icon. Click it to start adding a new subscription.
    *   The card will transform into an input form. Enter the **Canonical ID** of your dormitory (e.g., `5-202` or `E-505`). This is the unique identifier for your room.
    *   Click the **"Add"** button. If the ID is valid, a new subscription card will appear on your dashboard.

You can subscribe to a maximum of three dormitories.

## Understanding the Dashboard

The dashboard provides an at-a-glance overview of all your subscribed dormitories. Each subscription is displayed on its own card.

### Subscription Card Components

*   **Dormitory ID**: The `canonical_id` you used to subscribe.
*   **Latest Balance**: Shows the most recently recorded electricity balance (`kWh`) and the time of the reading (e.g., "a few seconds ago").
*   **Notification Status**: A badge indicating the current notification setup (e.g., "Off", "On", or specific rules like "Low Power").
*   **Action Buttons**:
    *   **View Trends** (Chart Icon): Takes you to the detailed usage trends page for that dormitory.
    *   **Settings** (Gear Icon): Opens a dialog to configure or test notification settings.

## Analyzing Usage Trends

The "Trends" page gives you a detailed look at your electricity consumption over time.

*   **Interactive Chart**: The main feature is a line chart plotting your electricity balance (kWh) against time. You can hover over any point on the chart to see the exact balance at a specific time.
*   **Time Range Selector**: Above the chart, you can select different time ranges to view your usage history, such as the last 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days.
*   **Depletion Estimate**: If there is enough data, the page will display an estimated time until your balance runs out, based on your recent consumption rate.
