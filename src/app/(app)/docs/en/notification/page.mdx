# How to Set Up Notifications

Dormitricity supports notifications through various channels to alert you when your electricity balance is low or is estimated to be depleted soon. You can choose from Webhook bots (WeCom, Feishu) or the ServerChan notification API.

## Configuring Notifications

To set up notifications for a subscription, follow these steps:

1.  **Open Settings:** On the dashboard, find the subscription card for the dormitory you want to configure. Click the "Settings" button to open the notification settings dialog.

2.  **Choose a Channel:** Select your desired notification channel from the "Notification Channel" dropdown menu. You can choose between "None", "WeCom", "Feishu", and "ServerChan".

3.  **Provide Your Token or Webhook URL:**
    *   **Automatic Detection:** You can paste a full Webhook URL directly into the "Notification Token / Webhook URL" field. The system will automatically detect the channel (WeCom, Feishu, or ServerChan) for you.
    *   **Manual Entry:** If you only have a token or SendKey, you can paste it into the field and then manually select the correct channel from the dropdown.

4.  **Set Notification Rules:**
    *   **Low Power Threshold:** Enable this option to receive a notification when your electricity balance falls below a certain level. You can set the threshold in kWh.
    *   **Depletion Threshold:** Enable this option to be notified when the system estimates that your electricity will run out within a certain number of hours.

5.  **Configure Cooldown:** Choose a cooldown period from the dropdown menu. This is the minimum time that must pass between notifications to prevent you from being spammed.

6.  **Save:** Click the "Save" button to apply your settings.
